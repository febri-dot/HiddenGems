   "what_can_i_do_first_paragrapgh_chocolate" : "First, the cocoa beans are sorted by size to determine the appropriate roasting time, ensuring we achieve that signature chocolate flavor. After sorting, the beans go through cracking and winnowing machines that separate the nibs from the shells. The pure cocoa nibs are then pressed into a coarse paste, while the shells are repurposed as fertilizer.",
   "what_can_i_do_second_paragrapgh_chocolate": "Next, the coarse paste is refined into a smooth cocoa paste, known as chocolate liquor or cocoa liquor. At this stage, additional ingredients like sugar, vanilla, and various flavors are incorporated. The diverse flavors of chocolate come from their fillings, which range from candied ginger to roasted cashews. Once melted, the chocolate is molded and then chilled in the refrigerator before the final packaging process.",
